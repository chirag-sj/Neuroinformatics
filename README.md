# Neuroinformatics
Corollary Discharge Mechanism helps in reducing the neural response to the self-triggered outcomes. This mechanism is hampered in patients affected with schizophrenia.
In this project, EEG data [data link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/broach/button-tone-sz) is analysed to verify this suppression hypothesis.
Methods used:
 - Event related potentials (trial and group averaged)
 - Time-frequency analysis (per participant visualization and permutation based cluster-level thresholding)
 - Connectograms (primitive)
